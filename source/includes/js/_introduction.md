## Introduction

Swell allows you to take even more control of your program by exposing a javascript object on the window called `swellAPI` which enables you to perform many Swell functions programmatically. In addition to the exposed object, Swell triggers events on the document object enabling you to hook into key interactions your customers are taking with the program.
